#Session Outline
1. Download and Install Git help, creating github account help (first 15 minutes)

2. Introductions (15 minutes)
3. Git Slides (adapted from U of T coders) (20 minutes)
  - Version control (3 slides)
  - describe git and github
  - why to use git
  - describe version control with git
  - describe git
  
4. Edit a text file and git it.
Work flow: 
  1. git configure

```{bash}
#This step you only do it once (first time using git on your user)
git config --global user.name "tarahenechowicz"
#your github username, check your github profile
git config --global user.email "tara.henechowicz@mail.utoronto.ca"
#also recommend using your github account email
```

  2. Create a Repository on Git  
  
```{bash}
#First step is we need to know where we are in our computer before we make a repository there. 
#To figure out where you are (if you're lost!):
pwd

#On mac you might want to change to a place that finder can see, like within our Documents folder, so we want to put our repository into a subdirectory of our Documents 
  #windows it is called "documents"
  #to change the director use the command cd 
cd Documents #name of directory
# to go backwards use cd .. to go back one level, have to do that twice for this project
cd ..
cd ..
#We are going to make a directory (or folder) for our project
mkdir GitPractice
# now let's go into the directory that we just made
cd GitPractice

```
  


```{bash}
git init ## Create the repository (init = initialize)

#change the default branch name to mastera
git config --global init.defaultBranch
```

Let's create a text file to store some data to work on
```{bash}
#use touch command and create a file
touch mydata.txt
```

Now, open the bio.txt file and add:

- Your name
- Your program and year
- Your progamming language/statistical language of choice

```{bash}
#we need to add it to the stage so it can be commited
git add mydata.txt ## Check the activity
#you can also do git add all to add all the files in the repository (remember we only have one right now)
git add -A
# git commit to save file to the history with a message (-m)
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Now we are going to back to the text file and make a change. 
- for example, I'm going to add my affiliation in the first line. 
```{bash}
#we can use git status to see the activity
#git status ## Check the activity

#git diff # shows the difference between the changes in our repo and the last commit

#git add -A #to add all of our changes in the text file

#git status ## should be green to show that our text file is on the stage ready to be commited

#git commit -m "modified my affiliation"

```


#PART II GitHub

1.Create a repository on github that matches the name of your repository on your computer

- take our repository from our computer and "push it" to github so it can be store on their server in addition to or instead of our computer
- Why would we want to do this? 
  1. storage (privately or publicly)
  2. Public sharing of data (open science)
  3. now that its on github your team members or even general public can collaborate with you on your work and you can log the changes of multiple users!

To push our repository to github, we need to first set up the connection between the repository on our computer with the repository on github

```{bash}
#go to the repository that we just made and there is the green button called "code" and copy the code from the https
git remote add origin https://github.com/tarahenechowicz/GitPractice.git

#will prompt to ask for your username

```

Git authetication token start up : https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token


-PAT lets git control your github account
- don't lose it its like a password. 
- if you forget it you have to do this process again.
- then 

 - verify email address
    - go to settings
    - developer settings, personal access tokens
    - "generate a personal access token"
    - recommended you change expiration, depends on the security of your data/code. 
```{bash}
#git push --set-upstream origin master #or main
#enter your github username
#copy and paste the token
```
 

try making more changes
go through the full workflow
and do git push



##Part 3 Github features
- useful for working together as a team

1. Make an issue in git hub to create your README.md (15 minutes)
```{r}
#pull requests on your own account 
#pull request 
  #when there is a divergence or a branch, it takes all the divergence and squish it back into the original

#issue
 #say you found a type
  # communicate with yourself, authors and teams 
#example
#other people can make comments
#assign it to people
#just an example of the many wyas github is helpful for collaborating with scientists.
```

###cloning
```{bash}
# move back to your documents folder
  #review, how do you find out which folder you are currently in? 
  #how do we move to the documents folder? 

#on github go to the repo you want to clone and hit the code button
#select https and copy that link to: 
#git clone <your readme https>
```

####branch and pull request
```{bash}
#make a new branch and make some change in the branch
#allows you to split off onto a new version of work without affecting the main branch. Helpful for version control if you want multiple versions of the same work. 
#to split between branches
#git checkout -b Tara
#option to create one if one doesnt exist

#git branch 
#will show all of the branches you have

# -b creates the branch, don't need it just to switch

#open the README.md file

 #git push --set-upsteam origin Tara
#now go to github and merge the changes with the main
```

### Forking
- straight forward
https://github.com/tarahenechowicz/Git-Demo
- make a new one
